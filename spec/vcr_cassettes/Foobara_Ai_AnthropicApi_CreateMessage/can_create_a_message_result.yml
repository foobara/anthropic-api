        pH of honey typically ranges from 3.4 to 6.1, with an average of around 3.9.
        This means that honey is generally acidic. The exact pH can vary depending
        on several factors:\n\n1. Floral source: Different types of flowers produce
        nectar with varying compositions, which affects the final pH of the honey.\n\n2.
        Geographic location: Environmental factors can influence the pH of honey produced
        in different regions.\n\n3. Processing methods: Some honey processing techniques
        may slightly alter the pH.\n\n4. Storage conditions: The pH of honey can change
        slightly over time, especially if not stored properly.\n\n5. Presence of enzymes
        and organic acids: These naturally occurring compounds in honey contribute
        to its acidity.\n\nIt''s worth noting that the low pH of honey, combined with
        its high sugar content and other antimicrobial properties, contributes to
        its ability to resist bacterial growth and act as a natural preservative."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":15,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":202}}'
